24.5.0                                                 ?. April/May 2024


TODO's
======               

* 

* [Tour Location] Automatically create tour locations for longer pauses in a tour 
   https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1306 
 
* Support column width = 0
  This is now (17.3.2024) set but needs more testing

* Support first column alignment in all views
 

* Update fulltext url https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_5_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#Wildcard_Searches
  in https://mytourbook.sourceforge.io/mytourbook/index.php/documentation/show-tours/search

* Remove debug code in ColumnManager.java
   // TODO
      System.out.println("All columns in _allDefinedColumnDefinitions, number of entries: " + _allDefinedColumnDefinitions.size());
      System.out.println();


* Maybe replace "Display.getDefault()" with "PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay()"
  "Code should always ask the workbench for the display rather than rely on Display.getDefault()"
  

* Tour Editor     - Remove experimental message box: net.tourbook.ui.views.tourDataEditor.TourDataEditorView.actionCreateTour(TourData)
                    Released: 23.3


* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly

				      - Do the data backup with a zip file which contains all db files

  - OpenWeatherMap: Migration to the One Call 3.0 API per the recent announcement
    Note: While the weather retrieval for this vendor remains free and the historical 
          weather data can be retrieved for the last 40+ years (from January 1st 1979),
          the total number of requests per day is limited to 1000. Because of this, 
          no more than 50 requests per day can be performed by each user.

Changes

  - Moved map location options into the new slideout for map locations
  


Bugfix
======

* Fit Export (Frederic)
  - Fix for the Suunto App replay issue

* Suunto XML/SML Import (Frederic)
  - Fix for the calories import values

* Tour location profiles
  The default location profiles were not translated in the last version. Now they are translated but the location names are saved in the configuraiton file C:\Users\<YOUR NAME>\mytourbook\.metadata\.plugins\net.tourbook\tour-location.xml and will not use the translated names. 
  To use the translated names, this files needs to be deleted when MyTourbook is not running but this will also delete any customizations which you have already done !

Translation    
===========

- Dutch (Maarten)
- French (Frederic)
- German
- Italian (Doriano)
