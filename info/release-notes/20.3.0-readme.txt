New + Improvements   
==================

* Tour Marker View (Frederic)

  - Added the following column : Average slope
  - Replaced pace difference column name by average pace

All changes/fixes from Frederic are documented here
 

* FIT File Import (bbbbbr)

  - Added option to set Tour Type using Sport Name and Profile Name from
    the simple imported file, more info is here.
  - When easy import is used, then it will overwrite the tour type from 
    the simple import, when it is accordingly configured.

 
Bugfix   
======

* 3D Map (Thomas)

  - Fixed java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 
    java.nio.FloatBuffer.clear()Ljava/nio/FloatBuffer
  - This occured in Java 8 â†’ tour tracks were not displayed

 
* 3D Map (Frederic)

  - Fixed a regression that appeared in 17.4.1 where the USGS layers 
    disappeared in the 3D Map Layer menu (due to the fact that WorldWind
    had changed the internal name of those layers from 
    "Topographic" to "Topo Scanned")
  - Fixed the pace format display for 3D map view

 
* Conconi Test (Frederic)

  - Disabling the deflection scale if there is no HR and/or power data 
    (otherwise if the users modified the scale it would create an NPE)

 
Translation    
===========

* French (Frederic)
