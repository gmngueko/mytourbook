25.next.0                                                 ?. February 2025


TODO's
======

* Support column width = 0
  This is now (17.3.2024) set but needs more testing

* Support first column alignment in all views
 
* Maybe replace "Display.getDefault()" with "PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay()"
  "Code should always ask the workbench for the display rather than rely on Display.getDefault()"
  http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbench.html#getDisplay%28%29

* Website         - IDE pref page: Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly

Issues
======

*


Experimental
============

* 


New / Improvements
==================

* Fit Import
  - Log all device sensor values, e.g. battery voltage or soft-/hardware versions
  
* Sensor view     https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1569
  - Show number of tours for each sensor  
  - All associated tours for a selected sensor can be displayed in the tour book view


Changes
=======

* Map properties view
  - This view is removed, its options are now available directly in the 2D map options slideout
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1543
  
* Elevation gain/loss
  - The elevation gain/loss values may have to be recomputed because these values will now be ignored during break times.  
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1545  

* Device sensors
  - This was a big rewrite to include also a device type because a sensor can have multiple device types
  - When a product name is the same as the product number, then the db update process tries to find a suitable Garmin device name
  


Changes that require Tour Re-import
