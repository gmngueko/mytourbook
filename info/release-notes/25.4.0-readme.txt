New

* Tour Marker Types
  https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1470
  - Setup tour marker types in the preferences
  - Apply tour marker types to tour markers
  - 2D Map
    - Display tour markers with different colors
    - Filter tour markers  


Improvements
============

* Import
  - Set a default tour type into all imported tours
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1442

* Easy Import
  - New Option "4.1 Remove 2nd last timeslice marker"
   Sometimes (in my case very often) a marker is automatically set by the device at the 2nd or 3rd last time slice. When selected, then this marker will be removed.

* 2D Map
  - Display a label in a displayed photo
