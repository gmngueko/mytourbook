    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1576
  - Reset all colors of one color definition to its defaults


Changes
=======

* Fit import
  - The import of swim values could create wrong tour distance values, mostly when a time slice was larger than 1 second.
    This can be fixed by reimporting swim values.

* Map properties view
  - This view is removed, its options are now available directly in the 2D map options slideout
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1543
  
* Elevation gain/loss
  - The elevation gain/loss values may have to be recomputed because these values will now be ignored during break times.  
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1545  

* Device sensors
  - This was a big rewrite to include also a device type because a sensor can have multiple device types
  - When a product name is the same as the product number, then the db update process tries to find a suitable Garmin device name
  - When tours are imported or re-imported without saving the tours, this will update the sensor type and name for existing sensors, when these values are not yet set
