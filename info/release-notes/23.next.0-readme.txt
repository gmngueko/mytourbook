23.next.0                                                 ?. March 2023


TODO's
======               


* AirQuality      - German translation https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1124

* Tour Chart      - Check "Grid/Units" and "Options" tab in pref page "Appearance/Tour Chart" if something is obsolete


* Tour Editor     - Remove experimental message box: net.tourbook.ui.views.tourDataEditor.TourDataEditorView.actionCreateTour(TourData)
                    Released: 23.3

* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly

Bugfix

* Tour Book (Frederic)
  - Hiding the temperature value when no value is detected instead of displaying 0 or 32

    Until now the marker viewer height decreased every time when this dialog was reopened.
