23.next.0                                                 ?. March 2023


TODO's
======               

* TRANSLATION

  - Inform translators to update the Messages editor by using the install procedure from
    https://mytourbook.sourceforge.io/mytourbook/index.php/development/translation/install-resource-editor
  - The internal newline char is now forced to Unix that different translators create the same output
  - The headerline shows the used messages editor and version
  - I'm using this https://github.com/mytourbook/eclipse-rbe messages editor which is faster when many languages are edited but it has the major disadvantage that new texts are not displayed in the "Problems" view


* Maybe replace "Display.getDefault()" with "PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay()"
  Code should always ask the workbench for the display rather than rely on Display.getDefault()
  

* Tour Editor     - Remove experimental message box: net.tourbook.ui.views.tourDataEditor.TourDataEditorView.actionCreateTour(TourData)
                    Released: 23.3


* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly
