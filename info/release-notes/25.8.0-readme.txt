25.8.0                                                 ?. August 2025


New / Improvements
==================

* UI Font
  - The font can be customized for all drawn texts 
    This was needed because since Eclipse 4.36 and MyTourbook is started with an -Dswt.autoScale=nnn parameter, then the font is scaled when drawing a text which could make the font too small or too large :-(
    
* Disabled Icons    
  - Select an algorithm how disabled icons should be converted

* All Charts
  - Customize y-axis width

* Tour Chart
  - Display values since the last tour marker in the value tooltip
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1473

* Tour Markers
  - Create or remove tour marker label numbering
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1496

  
* workbench.xmi
  - Fix 2 issues in workbench.xmi
    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/issues/1516  


Changes
=======

* Disabled Icons
  They are now better "disabled" with Eclipse than before. Some disabled icons are replaced and can be looking a bit differently than before

* Eclipse on Windows is now using Edge as default browser which needed a few adjustments

* Fit Import
  Swimming tours should be re-imported that fixes are applied to already saved tours.
