20.2.0                                                 19. February 2020 


New + Improvements   
==================

* Calendar - Weekly summary (Frederic)
  - Time spent in "slow" vs "fast" cadence zones

* Tour Marker (Frederic)
  - Added the following columns : Elevation Gain Difference, 
    Elevation Loss Difference, Pace Difference, Average heart rate

* Compare Result (Frederic)
  - Added the ability, in the Views Preference Page to show/hide the 
    tour tooltip in the Tour Compare Result View
 
* Tour Editor (Frederic)
  - Added the ability to retrieve the weather data by clicking on the 
    weather description label
  - Added a Time slices editor window to offer the ability to 
    efficiently edit specific values of Altitude/Pulse/Cadence/
    Temperature. 
    Those values can be quickly found thanks to the added ability to 
    sort those columns in ascending/descending order.

 
Changes  
=======

* Tour Import
  - GPX: Set default to absolute distance that the defaults for export/
    import are the same
  - FIT: Starting marker label from 1 instead of 0


Fixes   
=====

* Statistics
  - Show tooltip for the bottom bars, the hitbox for the horizontal 
    slider starts now below the horizontal line (for a bar chart)
  - Fixed issue: Tour type in tooltip is wrong for the first item 
    (year/month)

* Tour Tags
  - Fixed issue: Column widths have been reset when tags are saved
  
* Tour Import
  - GPX: Fixed NPE when importing MyTourbook export files
  - FIT: Fixed NPE when importing files with developer fields that are 
    null

* Tour Export
  - GPX: <mt:bikerWeight> value was wrong

* Preferences (Frederic)
  - Fixed a regression, in the "Measurement System" tab, that appeared 
    in 19.3.0 where the metric radio buttons had disappeared
  - Fixed bugs in the Computed values preference page (Break Time and 
    Elevation Gain tabs) where the speed and altitude values were not 
    properly converted when switching between metric and imperial system 
    units

* Tour Tag filter (Frederic)
  - After deleting a tag, the tour tag profiles were not updated and if 
    the recently deleteg tag was present in tour tag profiles, an NPE 
    would appear

* Tour Editor (Frederic)
  - Fixed a bug when editing time slices. After editing a cell and 
    saving a tour, an edited cell would not be updated with a new value

* Photos (Frederic)
  - Fixed NPE when no folder is selected and a filter is applied

* Calendar
  - Fixed a bug in the calendar view where the speed was always 
    displayed in metric
