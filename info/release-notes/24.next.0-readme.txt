TODO's
======               

* !!!!!!!! Update contributors !!!!!!!!!

  https://mytourbook.sourceforge.io/mytourbook/index.php/contributors

* !!!!!!!! Update contributors !!!!!!!!!


* Remove debug code in ColumnManager.java
   // TODO
      System.out.println("All columns in _allDefinedColumnDefinitions, number of entries: " + _allDefinedColumnDefinitions.size());
      System.out.println();


* Maybe replace "Display.getDefault()" with "PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay()"
  "Code should always ask the workbench for the display rather than rely on Display.getDefault()"
  

* Tour Editor     - Remove experimental message box: net.tourbook.ui.views.tourDataEditor.TourDataEditorView.actionCreateTour(TourData)
                    Released: 23.3


* Website         - Save action must not be done manually, they are saved in e.g. net.tourbook/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs with the "sp_cleanup" key prefix
                    Need to check how to apply it to all projects, must maybe be done with the already existing ant script

                  - Style rule for actions, use "Title Case" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case
                    mainly e.g. 'at', 'of', ... should be lowercase otherwise it looks ugly
