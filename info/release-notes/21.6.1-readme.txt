21.6.1                                                 30. June 2021


Improvements
============
    
* Tour Search
  - New action in the context menu to select a tour with the mouse. 
    Selecting a tour with the mouse was not working anymore (since a 
    while) when using the embedded browser in MyTourbook    
    https://sourceforge.net/p/mytourbook/discussion/622811/thread/745a5ebd1b/#227a/ede2
  
* Tour Chart
  - Show value of the hovered graph point, can be disabled in the chart 
    options  
  - Set the default graphs in the graph slideout, previously it could be
    set only in the preferences dialog
  - Show values in the value point tooltip with the correct color when 
    using the dark theme  

* 2D Map
  - Enable/disable map dimming, moved map dimming parameters into 
    "2D Map Options" slideout
  - Legend units and scale colors depend on the map dim level
  
* Tour Data Editor
  - New action to delete time slices and adjust the tour start time
    This can be helpfull when a GPS device had no connection at the tour 
    start and the tour start time is totally wrong.
    The author had a tour whose tour start time was postponed 19 hours 
    until the GPS signal was received
