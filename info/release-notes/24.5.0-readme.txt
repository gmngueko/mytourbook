  - OpenWeatherMap: Migration to the One Call 3.0 API per the recent announcement
    Note: While the weather retrieval for this vendor remains free and the historical 
          weather data can be retrieved for the last 40+ years (from January 1st 1979),
          the total number of requests per day is limited to 1000 for all users. 
          Because of this, no more than 50 requests per day can be performed by each user.

  Some of the tour import improvements or fixed are not automatically applied to already imported tours. To see these changes, the tours have to be reimported.

  Device sensors are now imported which do not contain a serial number
  -> Now there can be new sensors in the sensor view which were currently ignored !

* 2D Map Options
  Moved map location options into the new slideout for map locations

* Tour Concatenation
  Elevation up/down values are now ignored between joined tours

    https://github.com/mytourbook/mytourbook/discussions/1194

* Tour location profiles
  The default location profiles were not translated in the last version. Now they are translated but the location names are saved in the configuraiton file C:\Users\<YOUR NAME>\mytourbook\.metadata\.plugins\net.tourbook\tour-location.xml and will not use the translated names. 
  To use the translated names, this files needs to be deleted when MyTourbook is not running but this will also delete any customizations which you have already done !

Translation

- Dutch (Maarten)
- French (Frederic)
- German
