19.10.0                                                 30. October 2019


Experimental: Delete Tag / Tag Category
=======================================

   This is a New Feature

   A new feature that deletes something should always be used with care 
   and attention.

   This feature has been tested and worked properly. However, backing up
   the tour data is always a good advice.


New + Improvements   
==================

Changes  
=======

* Altitude -> Elevation (Frederic)

  - Changed wording for the english texts from Altitude to Elevation

    Earth's surface, while altitude (...) is used for points above the 
    surface" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation

    on the earth surface and not in the air

Bugfix   
======

* Tour Chart

  - Imperial elevation/altimeter values could be wrong depending on the 
    selected measurement system and when the tour was displayed the 
    first time
  - When multiple tours are displayed and some of the tours have no 
    distance, then the line graph was painted to x=0 which was showing a
    corrupted graph with triangles
  - Show RPM/SPM correctly in the valuepoint tooltip 
    https://github.com/wolfgang-ch/mytourbook/issues/86

    now accepts 1 decimal

 
* Body Weight Unit (Frederic)

    in the UI

  - Distinguishing between manual activities and activities with tracks
  - Converting Calories (unit used in ST) to kilocalories (unit used in 
    MTB)

 
* Fitlog Import + Tour Book View

  The tour start time was wrong and needed these 2 fixes

  - Fitlog Import
    - Fixed tour start time year/month/day by using it's time zone
  - Tour Book View
    - Extended Set Time Zone wizard to set tour start time 
      year/month/day with time zone  

 
* Import (Frederic)

  - Fixed a bug that confused the user when re-importing multiple files.
    If one of them was invalid, the log would display the valid 
    re-imported files as invalid files that could not be re-imported
  - Fixed a bug when reimporting a subset of tours contained in files 
    that have multiple tours. The reimport is now enabled for all files 
    except .Fit files

 
* CM4xxM Import (Meinhard)

  - Fixed endless loop when reading a CM4xxM DAT file
