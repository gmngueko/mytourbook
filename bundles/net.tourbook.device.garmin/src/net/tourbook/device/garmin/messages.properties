GarminTCX_SAXHandler_FileIsEmpty            = [TCX] %s - is empty
GarminTCX_SAXHandler_InvalidDate_2007_04_01 = [TCX] %s - starts with the date 2007-04-01 which is probably wrong. The date is adjusted to the first occurrence of a different date which is: %s

Garmin_Transfer_CommunicationError = A communication error occurred.
Garmin_Transfer_DataFrom           = Transfer data from: 
Garmin_Transfer_DataTransferError  = Data Transfer Error
Garmin_Transfer_ErrorReceivingData = An error occurred while receiving data.
Garmin_Transfer_NoConnection       = No connection to garmin device.
Garmin_Transfer_UnknownDevice      = Transfer data from unknown Garmin device.

PrefPage_TCX_Checkbox_IgnoreSpeedValues          = Ignore device speed values
PrefPage_TCX_Checkbox_ImportIntoDescriptionField = Into the &description field
PrefPage_TCX_Checkbox_ImportIntoTitleField       = Into the &title field
PrefPage_TCX_Checkbox_PausedTimes                = Set &paused times from computed break times
PrefPage_TCX_Group_ImportNotes                   = Import <Notes> tags
PrefPage_TCX_Label_IgnoreSpeedValues             = Normally, speed values are computed when time and distance values are available. \n\
                                                   \n\
                                                   When device speed values are available, then these values are used, however smoothing of speed values cannot be used.\n\
                                                   \n\
                                                   This feature is also helpful when device speed values are wrong.
PrefPage_TCX_Label_ImportNotes                   = Where should the <Notes> tag be imported
PrefPage_TCX_Label_PausedTimes                   = There is not an official documentation and clear explanation on how the TCX pauses are represented and therefore there is some guessing.\n\
                                                   \n\
                                                   When enabled, then the pauses are not guessed, they are computed like the break times.

PrefPage_TCX_Radio_ImportIntoTitleTruncated      = &Only so many characters
